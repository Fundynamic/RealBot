<h1>Adding Game/Mod Support
</h1>

<b>Note that the list of supported mods is now provided separately; see <a
href="supportedmods.html">Supported Mods</a>.</b>

<p>
If you want to have support for your game/mod added, you'll need to send me
(wd@metamod.org) the following information:

<h3> Basic Info </h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Game name:</b>
<li> <b>Homepage URL:</b>
<li> <b>Game version:</b>
<li> <b>Game directory:</b>
<li> <b>Win32 DLL name:</b>
<li> <b>Linux SO name:</b>
<p>
<li> also, <b>List of game entities</b> <a href="#entlist">(see below)</a>
</ul>

For instance, Counter-Strike would be:

<ul>
<li> <b>Game name:</b> Counter-Strike
<li> <b>Homepage URL:</b> http://www.counter-strike.net/
<li> <b>Game version:</b> 1.1
<li> <b>Game directory:</b> cstrike
<li> <b>Win32 DLL name:</b> mp.dll
<li> <b>Linux SO name:</b> cs_i386.so
</ul>

Many of these can be found in the <b>liblist.gam</b> file in the mod.

<a name=entlist><h3>List of game entities</h3></a>
<p>The <b>major</b> information that I'll need is the names of any non-standard
entities the game uses, for instance TFC uses things like:
<p><pre>
   building_sentrygun
   detpack
   func_nobuild
   ghost
   info_player_teamspawn
   info_tfgoal
   item_artifact_envirosuit
   i_p_t
   item_tfgoal
   i_t_t
   teledeath
   tf_ammo_rpgclip
   tf_gl_grenade
</pre>

<p>You can see the complete lists of entities for supported mods in the <a
href="http://metamod.org/dl/metamod/ents/">files in the "ents" directory</a>.

<p>The reason these are needed is that the macro
<b><tt>LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS</tt></b> in the HL SDK actually
declares/defines a function with the name of the entity, which the engine
will <tt>dlsym</tt> and call in the gameDLL.  Since Metamod is sitting
between the engine and the gameDLL, it needs to pass on the call to the
function - but can't do this unless it knows ahead of time (at compile) to
declare/define a function for that entity name.  Thus, metamod needs a list
of any entities that have functions declared/defined for them in the
gameDLL via LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS.

<p>Now, the simplest way to generate the list is to grep the source files
for <tt><b>LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS</b></tt>.  If you're not familiar with
grep, it's a tool under linux for searching contents of files.  For
instance:

<p><pre>
   grep LINK_ENTITY_TO_CLASS *.cpp *.c *.h
</pre>

<p>If you don't have linux available, then you may have to use some other
tool under win32 to find a similar list.  Or find a copy of grep for win32.
:)

<p>Note this all assumes you have access to the sourcecode for the mod.  If
you don't have access to the code, you'll need to find someone who does and
ask them to grep the source for the entities.
