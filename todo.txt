- Bots may not camp when last in team (or second last?)
- Bots should know when others are near its waypoint, so it won't run into each other - Done but not fully tested!
- Bots should have better knowledge about goals (mainly for investigating which bomb site got the live C4 in and hostages)
- Improve pathfinder by properly removing excessive connections, especially on ones that have blocked pathways - Not fully tested!
- Allow bots to duck jump for vaulting upon crates or ledges, cs_italy, de_nuke and de_inferno are good examples - Almost done!
- Improve the way bots walk path and decide it is a bad connection
- Improve 'unstucking'... when not stuck by hostages and how to attack glass or vent grills in order to proceed.
- Allow bots to autovacate for human players
- Prevent bots from Team Killing when a player joins T in CZ
- To allow bots to really, I mean REALLY ignore nodes from VERY hard to reach places - including non-vaultable edges and tall crates
- Find an automated solution for removing redundant or excessive nodes that can make the connections less messy (if it doesn't already exist?)
- To add a cvar to toggle Reallog.txt on or off to reduce printing too many texts in the console and to prevent that txt file building up
- Ensure that the RealBot personality directories are correctly assigned
